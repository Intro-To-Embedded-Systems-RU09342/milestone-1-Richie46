# Milestone 1: Communicating with Will Byers

For this assignment, code had to be written that would allow the msp430g2553 to control a RGB LED through PWM as well as enable communication between micro controllers through UART. This was done by first setting up two timers that would control the three colors on the LED using hardware PWM based on the transmission that was received. This meant essentiall just chaning the timer to up mode, changing the output mode to set/reset, and creating interrupt conditions for max duty cycle and desired duty cycle. In order to read the transmission and send another message to the next micro controller, a switch case statement was created to read one byte at a time. This would allow the micro controller to read the information that it needs for its own LED and send the rest of the information that the other micro controllers would need.
